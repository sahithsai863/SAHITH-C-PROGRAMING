//WORKING OF LOGICAL OPERATORS

LOGICAL AND:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;
    if (a < b && b == c) {
        printf("Both conditions are true.\n");

OUTPUT:-
At least one condition is false.

LOGICAL OR:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;
    if (a > b || b < c) {
        printf("At least one condition is true.\n");

OUTPUT:-

At least one condition is true.

OUTPUT:-

Condition is false.
